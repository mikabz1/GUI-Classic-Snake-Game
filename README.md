# Project Summary:
This is a study project, one of the first projects I wrote a long time ago.
The project is a classic Snake game with a graphical interface using WinForm and C#.

-The game saves the high score.

-Every time the snake "eats" it gets longer and faster.

The difficulty was mainly in planning the "tail" of the snake - which would follow the head, and which would extend after eating.

The project was created entirely in Visual Studio and with the help of WinForm.
I uploaded here mainly the code files and not all the project files.
